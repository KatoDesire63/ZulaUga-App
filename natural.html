                  The source of the Nile is located at the point where
                  the river emerges from Lake Victoria in Jinja.
                  This is considered the starting point of the Nile River,
                  which is one of the longest rivers in the world.
                  The area around the source is a popular tourist destination,
                  offering activities such as boat cruises,fishing,and visits
                  to the nearby monuments.

                  Speke in 1862. The surroundings are lush and green,providing
